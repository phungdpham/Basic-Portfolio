                <p>My name is Phung Pham. I am a saleperson in Orlando who loves to work with my clients. 
                    They are salon owners, most of whom like to build business website and applicaiton
                    for their salon. This is the reason I like to take UCF coding bootcamp to become web developer who can create beautiful websites for my clients. 
                    After finishing this coding class, I hope I can use my coding skills to make super fast, and super fun websites.</p><br>
                <p>I have a business background, so I started finding a little bit difficulty in learning technician things such as building website
                    but I will do my best. This is an opportunity for me to change my career or having another job besides my current sale job.
